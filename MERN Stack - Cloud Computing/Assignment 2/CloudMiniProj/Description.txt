Project is based on book store application
Created with Nextjs
Hosted on AWS ec2 server
Data is stored in mongodb database
Updates entry in database for cart number instead of creating new entry
Cart number is saved in seperate component so navigation panel doesnt reload with every decrement or increment
Add to cart creates new entry in database
Delete button in cart deletes entry assosiated with id
