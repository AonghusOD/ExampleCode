# MERN Stack Assignment

As part of the assignment we were requested to create a frontend using Nextjs to be hosted on AWS servers. Mongodb is used as the database. 

Nodejs is used as middleware to handle requests from web application and database. 

Express.js is used for URL routing and handling HTTP requests and responses.

# Getting Started
Nextjs and Node can run independently using default data but any changes will be reverted back to defaults if page is refreshed. 

If data would like to be stored in a database, Mongodb will need to be installed and running "before" node server is started.

```
Download folder "MERN Stack Site"
```
```
Create new folder "fsd" directly on the "C" drive.
```
```
Copy both "next" and "node" directories to "c/fsd.
```

## Install Dependencies and Start Servers

- Start command prompt or terminal

```
cd C:\fsd\node\node-blog
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
```
cd C:\fsd\next\nextjs-blog
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```
Application can be seen running via internet browser at address:
```
https://localhost:3000/
```
